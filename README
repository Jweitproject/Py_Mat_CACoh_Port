Raw data contains *_.mat = MATLAB data and *_Py_*.mat for Python data that are compared using Comparing_file.py
CACoh.py works by including all necessary data (*.fif and *.wav) in the same directory. You can change the directory structure if you use it at your device.

Difference Score Plots contains Cohxy values for each Timepoint and Participant, flattened and substracted.

If documentation is needed, a report can be provided explaining on the theory of CACoh, Python/MATLAB and the workflow of creating this ported CACoh MATLAB program.

.CSV comparing Cohxy is not uploaded due to exceeding data size of 100 MB (Per subjects time point ~1  GB)
